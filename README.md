# GNR650-Advance_DL
this repo will contain the experiments, assignments of the course GNR650-Advanced topics in deep learning for image analysis

## Assingment - 1
#### task performed
* overfitted resnet model on cifar-10 dataset (small sample)
* looked at the values of weights and biases of each layers
* visualized the kernels
#### how to get the Resuls
* the notebook is -  **'Assingment-1\resnet_overfitting_visualization.ipynb**
* download and run in colab/kaggle or any other platform
* no additional things to be done

## Paper review
* added a one page review of the paper “ViViT: A Video Vision Transformer”
* the pdf is present at **Paper Reviews\Review on the paper “ViViT_ A Video Vision Transformer”.pdf**

## Assingment - 2
#### task performed
* used a vit_b16 model pretrained on IMagenet for classification task on eurosat datset
* visualized the kernels and filters at conv layers - when no finetuning is done
* visualized the kernels and filters at conv layers - when classifier is finetuned
* visualized the kernels and filters at conv layers - when base of model is finetuned
* visualized the kernels and filters at conv layers - when complete model is finetuned
#### how to get the Resuls
* the notebook is -  **'Assingment-2\vit-finetuning-and-visualization.ipynb**
* download and run in colab/kaggle or any other platform
* no additional things to be done
